## our team contract:

- conflicts: let make everyone make their case (pros and cons), and discuss, possibly resolve with a vote, or random spinner in case of tie — also could potentially ask instructor opinion of best methods
- frustrations: discuss kindly what expectations of others are for this project
- professionally discuss point of frustration, construct a plan to overcome frustration with group
    - convo: hey, i’ve noticed this goal should’ve been accomplished by now. are you stuck or needing help? can you have it done by xyz?
- notify entire group of main pushes, personal branch pushes are permitted as needed
- being communicative is our main priority! get sign off of merges from all members in group slack.
- asking for help: after problem has been throughly communicated, and everyone has attempted
    - have list of questions ready for when instructors answer ticket
- getting stuck: ask for help from teammates, search resources, possibly huddle if available
- partnerships: discuss strengths, maybe pair someone who feels more comfortabe in said area to work with someone who feels less comfortable in that area
- pair dynamics: make sure to keep in contact with your partner, and the group as a whole. will work as driver and navigators, unless project and knowledge permits both partners to be working on separate components
- pair norms: up to group’s discretion, can use a not super strict timing method to switch if desired, agreed to finish your code if you’re on a roll!
- partners: switch partnerships daily potentially. this will also depend on tasks and assigned roles
- group is very open to working outside of class hours! we can communicate these times in group slack
- working solo: okay as long as objectives and work is discussed beforehand, make sure to push to personal branch only
- standups: 
What did I do yesterday?
What am I working on today?
What/ if any progress preventors I may have?
**standups will take place at beginning of day** when breakout rooms opened to discuss daily plans and objectives & **end of day** ~3:15 pm CT to discuss current progressions and accomplishments and directions for the following days
